# Day 1 

Hey guys welcome to the first day of this series of sessions. 

We will start by setting up your laptops with python installed. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system.

- [Windows](./../setup/windows.md)
- [Linux](./../setup/linux.md)

In case you are running on a Kali Linux system check out [#1](https://github.com/analytics-club-iitm/Daily-Sessions/issues/1#issuecomment-603458212) 

We have also included an Ubuntu installation [guide](../setup/ubuntu-install.md) if you guys want to have ubuntu along with windows in your system. 

**Note: it is not necessary for you to have Ubuntu/Linux but its something which you can definitely try out**

#### Please feel free to contact us incase you face any issues.

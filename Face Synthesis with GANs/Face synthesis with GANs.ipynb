    "# Face synthesis with GANs in PyTorch (and Keras)\n",
    "**Nishant Prabhu, 30 July 2020**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build and train a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize faces of people. I'll begin with a brief introduction on GAN's: their architecture and the amazing idea that makes them work. Then, we'll look at some code to get this to work for us. I'll leave you with some ideas which can help you make them produce better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Since most of the tutorial involves PyTorch, all tensors will de represented in the NCHW format, i.e. (batch size, channels, height, width).\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<div class=\"row\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"column\" style=\"float: left; width: 50%; padding: 0px;\">\n",

    "Let's say the features you used to tell this man from that dog are the edges of the image. While you would successfully be able to differentiate between the two, will you (assume you have never seen humans or mirrors before) be able to reconstruct the image of the man or the dog using only those features? Chances are you cannot. This is because the image's edges aren't enough to describe the man or the dog in sufficient detail. Such features are called **discriminative features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a major shift in interest took place in 2014 when Ian Goodfellow et. al. presented the **Generative Adversarial Networks** to the community (it would be unjust to say generative models were unknown at that time, however). This class of models called **generative networks** extract features from data that describe it as an individual. What's more interesting is that the converse holds true: given a description of the features, the models can reconstruct the data to represent those.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A GAN consists of two networks playing a minimax game. The architecture of this model is shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/afXgjbo.png\" alt=\"gan model\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this model is trained clearly explains why it works. Let's say there is some form of data that we want to synthesize (MNIST digits, for example). We will assume that each image in the dataset can be near-completely described using a vector from a distribution $f(x)$ (called the **latent distribution)**.\n",
    "1. The generator $G$ is given a batch of **latent vectors** from $f(x)$. We expect each of these vectors to correspond to some image (doesn't matter which). $G$, being untrained, uses these vectors to generate some images which are just noise.\n",
    "2. A separate batch of good images is picked out from the dataset and combined with the noisy images the generator created. Now, we create class labels for these images: 0 if the image is real and 1 if the image is fake.\n",
    "3. This batch of real + fake images and their labels is used to train the discriminator $D$. It's sole job is to tell whether an image is fake or not. Since the images made by $G$ are quite bad, $D$ learns its job fairly quickly.\n",
    "4. The magic happends now. Another batch of latent vectors is drawn from $f(x)$ and $G$ generates their corresponding images. This time, we associate inverted labels with these images - we say that all of these images are real (class label 0). This batch is passed into $D$.\n",
    "5. Since $D$ is well trained, it will immediately predict that all of these images are fake. This results in a large classification loss, which we propagate backwards. But before that, **we render $D$ untrainable**. This does two things: \n",
    "    1. The generator receives the loss that its poor images caused. It modifies its weights so that next time, the images it makes look more realistic. \n",
    "    2. The discriminator does not learn the inverted weights. This is important because we need $D$ to bust $G$ as effectively as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time this cycle is repeated, $G$ becomes better and better at generating more realistic images, while $D$ has to keep track of $G$'s antics so it can still tell the real images from fake ones. Note that it is necessary for both networks to get better at each step: if the discriminator performs poorly, the generator will be satisfied with whatever silly images it is making and won't learn to the level we desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this a minimax game?** The discriminator always tries to reduce the loss while the generator tries to raise it (by making the discriminator call its fake images real). The equilibrium reached by this duo determines the quality of output that we obtain from the generator. GAN seeks to optimize the loss function shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(x,z) = E_{x}[\\log (1 - D(x))] + E_{z}[\\log(D(G(z)))]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $x$ represents the data (like an image) and $z$ represents the vector drawn from the latent distribution $f$.\n",
    "1. The first term is the loss due to **real images**. The discriminator tries its best to predict that they're all real (0), driving that term to zero. \n",
    "2. The second term is the loss due to **fake images**. The generator tries its best to make the discriminator predict that its image is real, driving that term towards $\\infty$. The discriminator tries its best to tell that it's fake, driving that term to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About this project\n",
    "In this project, we are going to build and train a GAN for generating synthetic faces of people. The specific type of GAN used to generate image data is called **DCGAN** (Deep Convolutional GAN). We are going to use a subset of the Flickr Faces dataset. This dataset consists of faces of random people of various age groups looking in various directions, clicked in varying lighting conditions. Since the original images contain a good amount of background, we will first use a pretrained model ([MTCNN for keras](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn)) to crop out the faces from these images. Also we resize the images to $(64 \\times 64)$ and grayscale it, so each image is finally of size $(1, 64, 64)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "MTCNN can be installed as a Python package using pip. MTCNN runs on a Tensorflow backend.\n",

You can read more about them [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/transposed-convolution-demystified-84ca81b4baba). The outputs of the last convolutional layer are provided `tanh` activation. Sigmoidal activations in the output have been observed to provide better results. We use `tanh` since it has a larger active region (where gradient magnitudes are sufficiently large). This is the reason why we transformed our images' pixels to lie between (-1, 1) earlier. \n",

This is known as **mode collapse**, but this is not the only process that results in it. To solve this, we randomly train the discriminator in a wrong way (with inverted labels) to ensure both the models are upskilling equally. This is done a small fraction of the time, which I have chosen to be 10% below."

    "That was a lot! But satisfying, I hope. There's definitely much more and better things this model can do. Here's what you can explore to get this to work better.\n",
    "1. **Wasserstein GANs**. There use a completely different loss function to train the networks. It makes the training process much more stable, and both networks never stop getting updated (the loss function ensures the gradients are never zero).\n",
    "2. **Progressive DCGAN for super resolution**. [This](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10196.pdf) publication by NVIDIA describes a model architecture for generation faces with very high resolution. In this model, new layers are (smoothly) introduced into the networks while they are training. So the model first learns to produce coarse images, then fine tunes itself to improve its resolution. \n",

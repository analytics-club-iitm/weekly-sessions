# Introduction to Neural Nets

In this session, we would be looking briefly at Neural Networks. The first notebook contains some basic introduction about Neural Nets, and why they are required. In the second notebook, we would be implementing a shallow neural network from scratch.

## Task
As mentioned in the second notebook, build a model for the same problem, by incorporating Softmax function.
